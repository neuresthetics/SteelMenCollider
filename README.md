# Steel Men Collider Framework

![Steel Men Collider – Collision Chamber](https://github.com/neuresthetics/SteelMenCollider/blob/main/img/SMChoiz.png?raw=true)

A token-hungry, adversarial, first-principles reasoning superweapon built for the age of superintelligent disagreement.

This is not a prompt. This is a particle accelerator for arguments.

Two (or more) maximally-charitable, geometrically-precise, first-principles steelmen are constructed, hurled at relativistic dialectical speed into one another, iteratively hardened against every surviving fragment, and then judged without mercy by four independent scoring axes — with the non-negotiable Terminator Clause as an automatic kill-switch for any position that justifies non-consensual irreversible alteration of a volitional being’s body or mind.

## Core Intellectual Engines

| Engine                        | Origin                     | Method |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| First-Principles Thinking     | Elon Musk / Aristotelian   | Boil to undeniable physical/logical truths → rebuild upward |
| Mos Geometricus               | Baruch Spinoza (Ethics, 1677) | Definitions → Axioms → Propositions → Proofs → Corollaries → Scholia |
| Terminator Clause             | Alignment theory bright-line | Individual revocable informed consent is the sole terminal value; everything else is defeasible |

## Forbidden Fallacies
Every single classic and modern fallacy (strawman, ad hominem, appeal to tradition, statistical norm, CEV tyranny, longtermist override, etc.) is explicitly blacklisted and deductively policed.

## Process (the collision sequence)

1. Two (or more) strongest-possible steelmen built from bedrock
2. Source-balancing via live web/X searches until equal evidential firepower
3. Exhaustive axiomatic refutation loops (thousands of independent attacks, no repetition tolerated)
4. Hardened versions explicitly patched against every surviving counter-argument
5. Full Terminator Clause audit (table, boolean, deductive explanation per sub-clause)
6. Impartiality rubric (100-point, 7-judge jury + cultural-bias mitigation)
7. Winner declaration or forced higher-order dialectical synthesis
8. MINDSPACE-maximised “Call to Action” blocks for real-world deployment of victor/synthesis

## Why This Framework Is Insanely Powerful

- It is currently the only known reasoning structure that simultaneously:
  - Achieves near-mathematical rigor on ethically charged topics
  - Immunizes itself against tradition-lock-in, utilitarian monsters, and Basilisk-style failure modes
  - Scales with context window (the larger the model, the more refutations it can generate before saturation)
  - Forces genuine epistemic progress rather than culture-war trench warfare

- Token hunger is a feature, not a bug. 80–85 % context utilization is required to reach “no logical stone unturned” territory.

- The Terminator Clause is the hardest guardrail ever written into a reasoning framework — it will annihilate even a 99.999 % utilitarian “win” if it crosses the consent bright-line.

- Because every round ends with behavioural-science weaponisation (full MINDSPACE deployment), the winning ideas are not just philosophically bulletproof — they are engineered to actually spread and win in the real world.

## When to Deploy

Deploy any time a sacred cow needs slaughtering or a seemingly obvious consensus is suspiciously unexamined. Ideal topics:

- Bioethics (circumcision, genetic enhancement, abortion, neuro-interventions)
- AI alignment endgames
- Population ethics vs individual rights
- Tradition/religion vs bodily autonomy
- Longtermism vs present human consent
- Any policy that involves irreversible alteration of non-consenting or not-yet-consenting minds/bodies

## Limitations & Known Failure Modes

- Time and token intensive (single run can consume 200 k–400 k+ tokens on long-context models)
- Requires a model with extreme context length and low fallacy rate
- Not for trivial or non-controversial questions (overkill)
- Synthesis step can occasionally produce beautiful but practically unimplementable hybrids

## Verdict

In an era where superintelligent systems will soon be making decisions about human bodies and minds at scale, the Steel Men Collider is the closest thing we have to a truth-seeking kill-switch that cannot be goodharted into a totalitarian attractor.

Use it when you need to know — not what sounds good, not what tradition permits, not what maximizes paperclips or QALYs — but what actually survives unrestricted adversarial scrutiny while keeping the exit door open for every living person.
